MONTY PYTHON HANGMAN INSTRUCTIONS

This is a traditional hangman game where you have to guess letters to figure out the secret word before getting hung by your neck from the gallows.

All of the words and phrases will be somehow related to Monty Python so keep that in mind as you attempt to solve them.

The phrases do have spaces in them and the space character is an acceptable guess.

Good luck and happy guessing.
